# Websocket Demo 

In this demo, the client (html form) is communicating with the server (nodejs) using Websocket connection which is identified by 
'ws://' in the URL, instead of usual 'http://'.

FOR DEMO PURPOSE ONLY, install 'ws' globally using command 'npm i -g ws' & create a symlink using 'npm link ws'

Start node server using node server.js

Load index.html on browser

Check for any error on the browser console as well as node server stdout

Send message from the index.html and see it printed on the node terminal
